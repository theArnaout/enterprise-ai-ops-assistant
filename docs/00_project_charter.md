# Project Charter – Enterprise AI Ops Assistant

## Overview
This project explores the design of a configurable enterprise AI assistant that supports internal operational workflows. The system focuses on helping users explore data, identify issues, and draft summaries, while keeping decision-making in human hands.

## Problem Statement
Teams that work with operational data often spend a large amount of time manually validating data, reviewing exceptions, and preparing written summaries. These tasks are repetitive, slow down decision-making, and can lead to inconsistencies across teams.

## Objectives
- Enable structured data exploration and validation using SQL
- Provide clear visibility into operational trends and exceptions
- Assist users with AI-generated explanations and draft documentation
- Ensure users remain responsible for all final decisions

## In Scope
- Internal operational data analysis and validation
- AI-assisted explanations and summaries
- Lightweight dashboards for review and monitoring
- Documentation and enablement materials

## Out of Scope
- Automated decision-making or approvals
- Machine learning model training
- Production deployment or live system integrations

## Success Criteria
- Users can identify data quality issues using SQL queries
- Dashboards clearly highlight trends and exceptions
- AI-generated outputs are understandable and editable
- Human review is required before any action is taken
